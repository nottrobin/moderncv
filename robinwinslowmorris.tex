\setlength{\parskip}{6pt}

Over 18 years in software engineering, I've led the development of high performing full-stack web services and APIs across many languages and technologies including Python (Flask/Django), PostgreSQL, MongoDB and K8s.

As a manager, I've formed, led and grown efficient engineering teams with high retention and strong engineering culture. I've designed roles and team structures, improved team interactions, resolved conflicts and worked closely with stakeholders and product owners at all levels.  I've evolved team standards and implemented continuous delivery pipelines.

I'm an active open-source contributor, publishing many open source projects and modules. I've mentored engineers, given many presentations at conferences and international company events, an academic journal paper and written many blog posts.
