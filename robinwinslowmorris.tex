\setlength{\parskip}{4pt}

Over 18 years in software engineering, I've designed and developed high performing full-stack web services and APIs across many languages and technologies including Python (Flask/Django), PostgreSQL, MongoDB and K8s. I've evolved and implemented continuous delivery pipelines and evolved team standards.

\par

As a manager, I've formed, led and grown high performing engineering teams with high retention and strong engineering culture. I've designed roles and team structures, improved team interactions, resolved conflicts and worked closely with stakeholders and product owners at all levels.

\par

I've been an active open-source contributor, publishing many open source projects and modules. I've mentored engineers, given many presentations on technical and non-technical topics, including at conferences and international company events, and written many blog posts and an academic journal paper.
